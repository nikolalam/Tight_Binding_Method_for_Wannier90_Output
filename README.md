# Tight_Binding_Method_for_Wannier90_Output
A set of code intended to use the "wannier90_hr.dat" from Wannier90 to generate a set of physical property based on tight binding method

In this set of python code, Matplotlib and Numpy package was used in the calculation. The code was not optmised yet and the efficiency is a bit low. It will be update in the future. But the script is easy to understnad.

1. Solving_Band_Structure.py was used to generate band structure of the systme along high symmetry line which specify by the user. The basis vector, K point mesh, number of wannier function and  Fermi Energy was required to specified by the user.
